# Advento 2020

This is a try to complete (in time) the Advent of Code of 2020.

The project is built using Elixir, so you'll need Elixir and Erlang to compile and run it.

Getting started:

```
$ mix escript.build
```

That should generate the file `advento` and then you can run against the text files using the number of the day:

```
./advento -d 1
```

Unfortunately, it's implemented only 13 days. If you want to practice a bit, create a fork and provide a PR back, please ;-)
